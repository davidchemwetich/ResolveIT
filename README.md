# 🗺️ Complete Development Roadmap – Support Board (TALL + Pusher)

## 🏁 Week 1 – Foundation Setup

**Goal:** Get Laravel environment, auth, and roles ready.

* Install Laravel 11 project.
* Add **Breeze with Livewire** for auth.
* Setup **Tailwind + Alpine**.
* Install **Spatie Roles & Permissions** (Admin, Agent, Customer).
* Configure **Pusher** in `config/broadcasting.php`.
* Setup database + migrations.
* Create models: `User`, `Department`, `Ticket`, `Message`, `File`, `ActivityLog`.

✅ Deliverable: Clean Laravel base with working login, roles, and database schema.

## 🚀 Week 2 – Ticket System Core

**Goal:** CRUD for tickets + departments with priorities & SLA logic.

* Create **Department module** (CRUD).
* Create **Ticket module**:

  * Subject, description, status, priority.
  * SLA deadline auto-calculated by priority.
* Add **Ticket assignment** (assign to agents/department).
* Implement **Scheduler** job for SLA breach detection.

✅ Deliverable: Users can create tickets, assign them, and SLA timers work in the background.

## 💬 Week 3 – Messaging & Realtime

**Goal:** Real-time chat under each ticket.

* Build **Messages module** (Livewire component).
* Setup **broadcast events** for new messages.
* Configure **private channels** → only ticket owner + agents can join.
* Enable **file uploads** in messages.
* Store file metadata in DB and broadcast with message.

✅ Deliverable: Tickets act like chat rooms with real-time messaging + attachments.

---

## 🎨 Week 4 – UI Enhancements

**Goal:** Make it look polished & modern.

* Implement **dark/light mode toggle** (Tailwind + Alpine).
* Create **Admin dashboard**:

  * Open vs Closed tickets.
  * SLA breaches.
  * Tickets per department.
  * Agent performance.
* Add **Chart.js** for visuals.
* Implement **Presence channels** → show agents online/offline.

✅ Deliverable: App feels modern, interactive, and data-rich.

## 🔔 Week 5 – Notifications System

**Goal:** Email + in-app notifications fully integrated.

* Setup **Laravel Notifications**.
* Enable **queue system** (`database` driver by default).
* Create notifications for:

  * Ticket created
  * Ticket replied
  * SLA breached
  * Ticket closed
* Add **in-app notification center** (Livewire component).
* Sync with **Pusher** for real-time badge updates.
* Allow **user preferences** (choose email, in-app, or both).

✅ Deliverable: Notifications run through queues, emails don’t block, users get alerts in real-time.

## 📦 Week 6 – CodeCanyon Packaging

**Goal:** Make the product installer-ready & review-proof.

* Build **installer wizard**:

  * Step 1: Database setup
  * Step 2: Admin account
  * Step 3: Finish + login
* Create **sample seed data** (departments, demo tickets).
* Write **user documentation** (PDF/HTML with screenshots).
* Test on shared hosting (since most buyers use cheap hosting).
* Deploy **live demo site** with sample users (Admin, Agent, Customer).

✅ Deliverable: Polished, demo-ready product package for CodeCanyon.

## 🛠️ Ongoing (Polish & QA)

* Test with small + large ticket loads.
* Check SLA timers fire correctly.
* Confirm notifications work offline (emails still go).
* Validate file uploads are safe (MIME check).
* Optimize queries for dashboard.
* Run QA with 2–3 test users simultaneously.
